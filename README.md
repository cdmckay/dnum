Dnum
====

Dnum is a static class for accessing enumeration values much like the built-in .NET Enum class. Unlike Enum, Dnum is type-safe, reducing the number of enum-related runtime errors and eliminating the need for tedious, error-prone and inelegant down-casts.

Dnum also transparently supports the DescriptionAttribute? attribute, which allows you to conveniently use spaces and other characters in your enumeration constants.

Dnum 1.1 is now available [via NuGet](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Dnum).

For documentation on how to use Dnum, [see the Dnum project page](http://cdmckay.org/blog/projects/dnum/).
